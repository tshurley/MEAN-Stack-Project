# MEAN-Stack-Project

This frontend was generated with Angular CLI version 1.3.0.

This project adds a server side to the Angular 4 Tour of Heroes tutorial and it uses the MEAN stack:

Mongoose.js (MongoDB): database
Express.js: backend framework
Angular 4+: frontend framework
Node.js: runtime environment
Prerequisites
Install Node.js and MongoDB
Install Angular CLI: npm i -g @angular/cli
From project root folder install all the dependencies: npm i
Run
Development mode
npm run dev: concurrently execute MongoDB, Angular build, TypeScript compiler and Express server.

A window will automatically open at localhost:4200. Angular and Express files are being watched. Any change automatically creates a new bundle, restart Express server and reload your browser.

Production mode
npm run prod: run the project with a production bundle and AOT compilation listening at localhost:3000
